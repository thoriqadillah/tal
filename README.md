# Terminal Artificial Life
Terminal Artificial Life is a reimagining of artificial life simulation in terminal inspired by this video https://youtu.be/0Kx4Y9TVMGg

This project aims to teach me Go programming language in general, but it mostly just for fun and to see how it looked like if the simulation rendered in ASCII

It is to be expected not looked as good as if it was rendered in actual canvas, but who cares? As long as it looks cool, it doesn't matter, and I think it looks pretty cool

## Example

## The Motivation
I was watching youtube, and suddenly youtube recommended me the video and the video is really cool. I said to myself that I want to try the code, and I did. I did try the code in html and javascript environment. But it led my think that if I was going to try it, then maybe code it in different way. At the time I want to learn Golang because Golang is pretty popular in backend development. Well, technically, I did teach myself to learn Golang, but it was so boring because it was "yet another REST API project". I was having too many REST API project for learning purposse, and then I decided to make a project that has something to do with terminal, and then you know the rest of the story
